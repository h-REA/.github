# hREA Community Code of Conduct

## Personal Responsibilities

The hREA community collectively strives to foster an increasingly open, inclusive and caring culture.

**We ask all community participants to strive toward these Personal Conduct Guidelines:**

#### Respect diversity

We are committed to supporting social diversity and cultural sensitivity. Please support [our conduct standards](#our-standards) in all interactions.

#### Communicate gently

Participants are expected to support contemplative awareness and [nonviolent communication](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/4part_nvc_process.pdf) in our relationships. This is especially important in online communications. Please consider other perspectives in network-related activity.

#### Communicate effectively

Your voice is welcome. Your perspective is valued. Your interests are interesting. The best thing you can do to give and receive value is participate. Please consider the intended purpose of different communication channels within our organisation and choose the appropriate channel for different interactions.

Broadly, this means:

- [Github issues](https://github.com/h-REA/hREA/issues) for filing bug reports and feature requests
- The [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/um4UsxdFDk) for queries related to the [Valueflows](https://www.valueflo.ws/) model, hREA project status or building applications on hREA

#### Discuss concerns and questions

If you feel uncomfortable or uncertain about our issues or processes, please _identify your concerns_.

#### Resolve conflicts inclusively

We commit to resolve conflicts inclusively using a [Transformative Justice](https://commonslibrary.org/transformative-approaches-to-conflict-resolution/) approach, aiming to strengthen community and to fairly recognize all serious concerns. We encourage all conflicts to be resolved with the fewest people necessary, again acknowledging that everyone directly affected by the conflict needs to be involved. Refer to the Loomio [Conflict Resolution Guide](https://www.loomio.coop/conflict_resolution.html) which further explains this.

#### Mutual responsibility

We're all responsible, all of the time, to take positive action in response to harassment and abuse. In some instances, this may include reporting to external authorities. Our community expects all participants to take this responsibility seriously.



## Our Standards

hREA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all hREA spaces, including Github and our Discord server, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the hREA Community Management Team.

Some hREA spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, class, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

hREA prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. hREA Community Management Team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of hREA, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the hREA Community Management Team at conduct@hrea.io. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to hREA spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of hREA outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by hREA members, especially hREA Community Management Team, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from hREA based on their past behavior, including behavior outside hREA spaces and behavior towards people who are not in hREA.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of hREA members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, hREA Community Management Team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all hREA spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other hREA members or the general public.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This

ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
